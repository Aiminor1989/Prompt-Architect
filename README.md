This project was born out of the awareness of the importance of effective communication, with the main objectives to:
Reduce ambiguity and misunderstanding: Using words with different meanings in the same context often leads to multiple interpretations and can lead to misunderstandings. Identifying and promoting the use of universal terminology helps bridge this gap, ensuring that the message is clear and consistent.

Improve work efficiency and communication: Whether in business, education, science, or even everyday life, using precise words helps processes run smoothly, reduces time wasted on interpretation or misunderstandings, and promotes effective collaboration.

Creating a Positive Impact for the Future: Establishing standards for choosing the most appropriate and meaningful terminology will be a crucial foundation for knowledge development, innovation, and social progress. Clear and accurate communication leads to better decision-making, more accurate planning, and more targeted problem-solving, which will benefit all sectors in the long run.



How to use:
Prompt Entry: Users can enter their own generated prompts into the checkboxes provided on the platform.

Processing and display: The system will quickly process the prompts entered by the user and display the results obtained from running the prompts.

Component and Performance Analysis: In addition to the results, the platform analyzes and clarifies the components of the prompt, as well as assesses its practical application performance, helping users understand the strengths and weaknesses of their prompt.

Alternative Prompt Recommendations (Powered by AI): A key feature of this platform is its ability to recommend alternative prompts that convey the same outcome but are more effective. The platform uses AI technology to analyze a user's prompt and suggest more optimized prompts, which helps users choose the prompt that delivers the best results.



Benefits of use:
Understanding the meaning of universal terms: This way, users can see the different meanings and interpretations of the "universal terms" used in the prompt, which is crucial for creating effective prompts and reducing ambiguity.

Prompt Performance Improvements: The platform enables users to efficiently identify and debug their prompts, resulting in prompts that produce more targeted and higher-quality results.

Save time and resources: Reviewing and improving prompts before deploying them reduces errors and the need for repeated testing, saving users time and resources.

Learning and Skill Development: Users will gain knowledge and experience in creating more effective prompts through using the platform and AI-powered suggestions, enabling them to better develop skills in working with AI.



Ultimate goal:

The platform's ultimate goal is to provide a comprehensive and integrated tool for creating, reviewing, and improving AI prompts, enabling users of all levels, from beginners to experts, to create AI-generated content efficiently and effectively.

Additionally, to enhance efficiency and ease of use, users can save and archive their improved prompts as a personal library, allowing them to be quickly accessed in the future. Users can also share these powerful prompts with others in the community, demonstrating the versatility of the results they can produce and fostering collaborative learning to further develop their prompts.

ตัวอย่าง

Prompt:Image Editor

In the ImageEditor component, change the border style of the crop selection box from solid to dashed.

ในส่วนประกอบ “โปรแกรมแก้ไขรูปภาพ”ให้เปลี่ยนรูปแบบเส้นขอบของกล่องเลือกครอบตัดจากเส้นทึบเป็นเส้นประ

Prompt:Add a resize handles

In the ImageEditor component, add resize handles (like corner grabbers) to the cropping overlay, allowing users to adjust the size of the crop area. Make these handles visually distinct and interactive.

ในคอมโพเนนต์โปรแกรมแก้ไขรูปภาพ  Add a resize handle (เช่น ตัวจับมุม) ลงในโอเวอร์เลย์ครอบตัด เพื่อให้ผู้ใช้สามารถปรับขนาดพื้นที่ครอบตัดได้ ทำให้ตัวจับเหล่านี้มีความโดดเด่นและโต้ตอบได้อย่างชัดเจน

Prompt:Style Transfer

Add a new mode to ChronoSnap that uses the "Style Transfer" category to generate an image based on a user-uploaded reference image and their photo. Include UI elements for uploading the reference image, displaying its analysis, and triggering the generation. Ensure this integrates with the existing `generateTimeTravelImage` function, adapting the prompt as needed.

เพิ่มโหมดใหม่ให้กับ ChronoSnap ที่ใช้หมวดหมู่ "Style Transfer" เพื่อสร้างภาพโดยอิงจากภาพอ้างอิงที่ผู้ใช้อัปโหลดและรูปถ่ายของพวกเขา เพิ่มองค์ประกอบ UI สำหรับการอัปโหลดภาพอ้างอิง แสดงการวิเคราะห์ และทริกเกอร์การสร้างภาพ ตรวจสอบให้แน่ใจว่าฟังก์ชันนี้ผสานรวมกับฟังก์ชัน `generateTimeTravelImage` ที่มีอยู่ และปรับเปลี่ยนพรอมต์ตามความจำเป็น

Prompt:add a dedicated input field

In the 'Style Transfer' mode, add a dedicated input field where the user can manually type a prompt to refine the style analysis, overriding or supplementing the auto-generated one.

ในโหมด 'การถ่ายโอนสไตล์' ให้เพิ่มช่องป้อนข้อมูลเฉพาะที่ผู้ใช้สามารถพิมพ์คำเตือนด้วยตนเองเพื่อปรับแต่งการวิเคราะห์สไตล์ โดยแทนที่หรือเสริมคำแจ้งเตือนที่สร้างโดยอัตโนมัติ
